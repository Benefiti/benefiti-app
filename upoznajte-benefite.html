							<p>
								Numerous domestic and international companies, in order to
								attract, motivate, and retain employees, offer them additional
								benefits and privileges alongside the basic compensation
								package. In the Serbian market, these benefits primarily include
								<b
									>voluntary health insurance, gym membership, education budget,
									parking space, various loyalty</b
								>
								programs, and similar offerings. The benefits currently
								available in companies are based on the principle of
								<b>one size fits all</b> and generally relate to the same
								benefits offer for all employees. The question that arises
								is—can all employees be equally satisfied with the provided
								benefits in this way? Is it possible for an identical benefits
								offer to meet the desires and needs of all employees? Is the
								company budget being spent in the best possible way in this
								manner?
							</p>

							<blockquote><i>Global Trends</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								Global trends have shown that not only is it desirable but also
								a
								<b>necessary requirement for the personalization of benefits</b
								>. According to a recent study conducted in Serbia by the
								platform <a href="https://benefiti.rs">Benefiti.rs</a> in
								September 2020, involving a sample of 204 employees and 109 HR
								professionals, the key findings indicate that although companies
								invest significant resources in employee benefits (<b
									>7.69% of gross salary</b
								>), the benefits are not tailored to employee needs—<b>75.1%</b>
								of employees stated that they
								<b>do not participate in the selection of benefits</b>, and
								<b>30.5%</b> indicated that they
								<b
									>do not have a clear picture of which benefits are actually
									offered</b
								>
								by the company they work for. The underutilization of benefits
								represents an additional cost for the company—only
								<b>41.8%</b> of employees say they fully utilize the available
								benefits (in other words,
								<b>almost 60% of employees fail to make full use of them</b>).
								On top of this, 81.1% of the surveyed HR professionals stated
								that they
								<b
									>do not have a systematic approach to measuring the effects of
									benefits</b
								>, or their actual impact on engagement, satisfaction,
								motivation, and employee retention.

							<blockquote>
								<i>The Challenge of Personalized Benefits</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Faced with all these questions and challenges, we concluded that
								a large number of companies in our region are aware of the need
								for the personalization of benefits and are searching for
								solutions to this problem. In the current setup, the
								personalization of benefits would definitely require additional
								company resources. However, what if there is already an
								automated solution for personalizing benefits?
							</p>

							<blockquote><i>Platform Benefiti.rs</i></blockquote>

							<p>
								<b
									>Platform <a href="https://benefiti.rs">Benefiti.rs</a> is a
									Marketplace-as-a-Service</b
								>, allowing companies to provide their employees the opportunity
								to
								<b
									>independently choose a combination of benefits that suits
									them best from the widest possible range</b
								>
								(over 100 benefits) within a predefined budget on a monthly
								basis.
							</p>
							<p>The platform offers companies several key values:</p>
							<p>
								- <b>Time and cost savings</b> – the platform fully digitalizes
								and automates the process of providing benefits, where the
								client company no longer deals with procurement, negotiations,
								payments, logistics, and administration of benefit delivery with
								each provider separately; all of them are already available with
								their services and prices that are more favorable than market
								rates.
							</p>
							<p>
								- <b>Legal and tax security</b> - for each of the benefits
								available on the platform, the appropriate tax rate has been
								pre-calculated, automatically adjusted to the individual
								employee, all in accordance with the applicable tax regulations
								in the Republic of Serbia.
							</p>
							<p>
								- <b>One-stop-shop</b> concept - the total value of benefits
								will be calculated and paid through a single invoice, which
								cannot exceed the maximum budget set in advance by the client.
							</p>
							<p>
								- <b>Satisfied and engaged employees</b> – throughout the
								process, employees are key, as they are given the opportunity
								for choice and personalization in a simple manner. The focus is
								on those categories of benefits that have proven to have the
								most positive impact on employees, namely:
								<b
									>health, family, professional development and career, and
									mobility</b
								>.
							</p>
							<p>
								In their development journey, Benefiti.rs has formed strategic
								partnerships with
								<a href="https://manpowergroup.rs/">ManpowerGroup</a> and
								<a href="https://www.assert.pro/">Assert</a>, leaders in the
								domestic market for providing consulting services in the HR
								domain, as well as with the consulting company
								<a href="https://www.confida.rs/rs/">Confida</a>, which operates
								in the field of tax consulting and auditing, ensuring complete
								compliance of employee benefits with tax regulations.

            <p>And it&#x27;s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there&#x27;s still some hope; once I&#x27;ve got the money together to pay off my parents&#x27; debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ll do.</p>
            <p>That&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll make the big change. First of all though, I&#x27;ve got to get up, my train leaves at five. &quot; And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. &quot;God in Heaven! &quot; he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o&#x27;clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?</p>
            <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &quot;What&#x27;s happened to me? &quot; he thought. It wasn&#x27;t a dream.</p>
            <p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.</p>
