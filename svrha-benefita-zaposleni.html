								“The essence of a gift is not in what is given or done, but in
								the intention of the giver.” Seneca, Letters on Morality
							</p>
							<p>
								How many times have you heard or witnessed that a company has
								provided benefits for its employees that they don’t even use?
								What is needed for the introduction of a benefits system to
								truly be successful, and what benefits can companies derive from
								it?
							</p>
							<p>
								Benefits represent much more than one-time rewards, mere costs,
								unnecessary administration, and tax implications. Why is that so
								and
								<span class="bolded"
									>what is the purpose of employee benefits?</span
								>
							</p>

							<h4>
								Systematic Approach: There are no benefits that fit everyone
							</h4>
							<img
								src="https://aakdcmvkao.cloudimg.io/v7/https://benefiti.rs/blogs-img/Image_20230203_093430_905.png"
								alt=""
							/>

							<h4>
								What should employers think about when creating a benefits
								package for employees? What must we do if we want our employees
								to use these benefits and be satisfied with them?
							</h4>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										Financial Component of Compensation - “Hygienic” Conditions
										Met
									</h4>
									<p>
										Benefits will positively impact employees
										<span class="bolded">only when</span> we know
										<span class="bolded"
											>that salaries meet employee expectations</span
										>
										and when they are competitive in the context of standards
										for a given industry, position, seniority, and geography.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Personalization</h4>
									<p>
										A “one size fits all” approach never could have the same
										effects on different individuals; however, technology is
										finally here to enable personalization in practice. When we
										talk about personalizing benefits, we mean the possibility
										<span class="bolded"
											>for each employee to choose exactly the benefits they
											want.</span
										>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Flexibility</h4>
									<p>
										In a broader sense, flexibility is a key term that will
										define the future of employer-employee relations. When we
										talk about benefits, it is very important that the system
										allows flexibility for employees, which means that
										<span class="bolded"
											>they can change and adapt their choices to their new
											needs</span
										>
										as these change over time.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Categories of Benefits</h4>
									<p>
										It is very important to differentiate how various categories
										of benefits affect employees. What practice shows is that
										benefits that come from the categories of
										<span class="bolded">family, health, and education</span>
										have the most positive impact on employees because they are
										the most personal and “hit” the areas that are high on
										employees' priority lists.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Adaptation to New Ways of Working</h4>
									<p>
										In the post-pandemic era, one thing is certain – remote work
										and hybrid work will definitely remain present to a
										significantly greater extent than they were before the
										pandemic,
										<span class="bolded"
											>and benefits need to be suitable for remote work</span
										>
										so that employees can also choose benefits that are not tied
										to a physical location.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Employee Experience in Delivering Benefits</h4>
									<p>
										Technology has spoiled us quite a bit and set high standards
										in user experience. On Netflix or Amazon Prime, we can watch
										the movie we want at that moment; through CarGo or Uber, we
										can summon a vehicle we need with just one click on the app;
										on Airbnb, we secure accommodation in another city in just a
										few clicks. These are the standards we need to apply to
										benefits – to enable
										<span class="bolded"
											>an easy way to order and use benefits without any
											unnecessary administration.</span
										>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Communication</h4>
									<p>
										Something we often take for granted, but we shouldn’t. We
										live in a time when each of us is bombarded with hundreds of
										different messages daily, so it is important that
										<span class="bolded"
											>benefits are clearly and consistently communicated to
											employees using the most appropriate channels.</span
										>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Additionally, for us as employers, it is very important that all
								this is done in the
								<span class="bolded">most efficient</span> way, taking into
								account <span class="bolded">time and money</span>, i.e., that
								these processes are
								<span class="bolded">automated and digitized</span>, that we
								<span class="bolded"
									>only pay for benefits that are actually utilized</span
								>, that everything is
								<span class="bolded">compliant with tax regulations</span>, and
								that through
								<span class="bolded italic">people analytics</span> we can
								observe
								<span class="bolded"
									>the correlation of the impact of benefits on other HR
									metrics</span
								>
								(employee satisfaction and commitment, retention, absenteeism,
								etc.) and thus approach one step closer to calculating the
								<span class="bolded">ROI of benefits</span> (Return on
								Investment). Only then will we be able, when management or
								capital owners ask us, “What did we gain specifically and
								measurably by investing in benefits?” to respond in
								<span class="bolded">business language clearly</span> referring
								to concrete numbers and clear effects.
							</p>
							<p class="bolded">
								The effect of benefits: satisfied employees – a satisfied
								company
							</p>
							<img src="blogs-img/Image_20230203_093431_015.png" alt="" />

							<p>
								Now, let's return to the question of the purpose of benefits and
								the effects we can achieve through a good program. Once we have
								created a
								<span class="bolded">system</span> that provides a meaningful
								and efficient framework for delivering benefits, both for
								employees and, no less importantly, for employers, we need to
								define
								<span class="bolded"
									>what we can influence in our company through benefits.</span
								>
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>Care for Employees</h4>
									<p>
										One of the key values that a personalized benefits program
										focusing on benefits from the domains of family, health, and
										education can bring is
										<span class="bolded"
											>the message of the employer's care for each individual
											employee.</span
										>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Productivity</h4>
									<p>
										By investing in employees, employers gain a more engaged,
										loyal, and productive workforce. Indeed,
										<span class="underlined bolded"
											>SHRM's (Society for Human Resources Management)
											research</span
										>
										has shown that
										<span class="bolded"
											>companies that use benefits as a strategic tool for
											hiring and retention perform better (58%) compared to
											companies that do not (34%).</span
										>
										Therefore, if you want to achieve optimal results and
										satisfy all stakeholders, you will strive for your employees
										to be motivated, engaged, and efficient. If you offer them
										benefits that meet their needs, it will mean that you care
										about them.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Employee Retention</h4>
									<p>
										There is no need to elaborate on the costs of employees
										leaving the company. By introducing a quality benefits
										program, employee retention will be greatly facilitated, and
										many studies confirm this. For example, “Willis Tower
										Watson,” a global consulting firm with offices in over 140
										countries, discovered, through surveying around 18,000
										employees, that
										<span class="underlined bolded"
											>78% of them would stay in their jobs if the benefits
											program offered by their employer is good.</span
										>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Attracting Candidates and Building Employer Brand</h4>
									<p>
										Candidates today have the power of choice and are becoming
										increasingly selective in their job search; thus, they
										boldly demand a clear answer to the question of why they
										should work for you. If you
										<span class="bolded">offer personalized benefits</span>
										where
										<span class="bolded"
											>each employee can create a package tailored to their
											needs</span
										>
										and if through them you
										<span class="bolded"
											>demonstrate the value your employees hold for you, you
											will stand out from the rest</span
										>
										and thus gain an advantage in hiring talented and promising
										individuals. According to a
										<span class="underlined">Glassdoor survey</span>, 63% of
										respondents said they highly consider the benefits offered
										before accepting a job offer.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Promoting the Organization's Culture and Values</h4>
									<p>
										If the focus of the benefits program is on personal
										well-being, education, and the family sphere, it would
										convey a clear message that the organization cares about the
										well-being of employees as individuals. This, in turn, can
										greatly contribute to strengthening the
										<span class="bolded">company culture</span>, employee
										loyalty, and
										<span class="bolded">motivation.</span>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>Tax Efficiency</h4>
									<p>
										Companies can create a significant savings base with the
										appropriate structuring of benefits and the use of
										tax-efficient employee benefits, whether through
										<span class="bolded"
											>provision of benefits through a tax-free approach</span
										>
										or through making benefits such as health insurance costs
										tax-deductible.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>
								All this needs to be done
								<span class="bolded italic">as efficiently as possible</span>
								while having a clear connection to company goals. Only then can
								we talk about the essence of the benefits program and achieving
								mutual satisfaction for employees and the company.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you want to learn more about how to implement an efficient
								benefits system in your company,
