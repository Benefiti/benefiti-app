									The website of our company Smart Benefit Technologies d.o.o.
									Belgrade (<b>SBT</b>) -
									<a href="https://www.benefiti.rs">https://www.benefiti.rs</a>
									(<b>Website</b>) uses a number of different technologies, some
									of which we control ourselves (first party), and some are
									controlled by third parties (third party). These technologies
									include, but are not limited to, cookies, scripts, fonts, and
									images (<b>Technologies</b>). The listed Technologies
									primarily collect your data to provide a better user
									experience on the Website, customize the content of the
									Website for visitors, create our marketing activities, enable
									social media functions, as well as for other stated purposes,
									all aimed at providing a better experience for each individual
									visitor to our Website.
								</p>
								<p>
									All details regarding data protection with us and our
									compliance with regulations in this area, the data we process
									as part of our business activities, the legal grounds for
									processing your personal data, and the purposes and methods of
									data processing can be found in our
									<a href="obavestenjeoprivatnosti.html">Privacy Notice</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
									This Website Policy (<b>Policy</b>) applies exclusively to the
									official and only valid Website of our company. The
									technologies used by our platform Benefiti.app are not subject
									to this Policy.
								</p>
								<p>
									In accordance with the laws of the Republic of Serbia and the
									laws of the European Union regarding the protection of
									personal data of individuals to whom the data relates, we must
									obtain your consent for any use of the mentioned Technologies
									on the Website that are not deemed necessary, as well as
									provide you with clear information about what these
									Technologies are for, as well as about the third parties we
									cooperate with, which is explained below.
								</p>
								<br />
								<h4>Which Technologies do we use?</h4>
								<br />

								<ol>
									<li>About cookies</li>
									<br />

									<p>
										Cookies are small text documents (files) that contain a set
										of data needed to identify the internet browser of an
										individual visitor (a string of letters and numbers), which
										our website sends to the visitor's browser during a visit to
										the website, and which is stored on the hard drive of the
										visitor's computer, tablet, or mobile device
										(<b>Device</b>). Examples of cookies include login
										credentials, items in your online shopping cart, and
										tracking identifiers. A cookie on your device stores a small
										amount of data about your visit to the website. Upon each
										return visit to the website, the website retrieves the data
										contained in the cookies in the visitor's browser.
									</p>
									<p>
										Cookies can create personal data, i.e., data that relates to
										an identifiable natural person, either directly or
										indirectly. Cookies differ by duration, purpose, and the
										site that generated them. Cookies are set by both our web
										server and third-party web servers on our website, and they
										can read, update, or delete them each time you visit the
										website, depending on the type of cookie. Our website uses
										temporary and "permanent" cookies.
									</p>
									<p>
										Cookies that relate only to one user session (a one-time
										visit to our website) are temporary cookies, which have a
										duration limited to your visit to the website. They are
										automatically deleted when you close your internet browser
										and are usually considered necessary for the functioning and
										access of the website.
									</p>
									<p>
										Other cookies (such as tracking cookies or authentication
										cookies) are often stored for a longer period, which varies
										from a few days to several years. Thus, these so-called
										"permanent" cookies remain stored in the internet browser of
										the visitor's Device until a specific expiration date,
										unless the visitor deletes them before that deadline.
									</p>
									<p>
										Some cookies may impact your fundamental rights to privacy
										and personal data protection since they contain personal
										data that you, as a visitor to the Website, may disclose.
										For this reason, we require your consent for cookies to
										access or be stored on your Device. Precisely for this
										reason, as a company that prioritizes transparency in
										business and cares about your privacy, we limit the use of
										cookies in the manner detailed below.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Who sets them?</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										The website uses "permanent" and temporary cookies, some of
										which are set directly by us, but most are set by third
										parties. Specifically, our web server sets and stores
										so-called first-party cookies (<i>first party cookies</i>).
										On the other hand, third-party cookies (<i
											>third party cookies</i
										>) are set by third parties that provide us with support
										services for the proper functioning of the Website,
										advertising, or research for analytical purposes.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Which cookies do we use?</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										Our Website uses cookies for various purposes, but they can
										all be divided into the following categories of cookies
										based on their purpose:
									</p>
									<br />
									<ol type="A">
										<li>
											<b><i>Analytics/Performance Cookies:</i></b> These cookies
											are set by a third party for research purposes related to
											analytics. We use them to collect data on how visitors use
											our Website, which pages of the Website are visited most
											frequently, and how often, as well as how much time
											visitors spend on our Website. Furthermore, the third
											party that sets the cookie may also collect other
											information about you, such as your geographic location,
											IP address, type of Device you are using, and other
											information about the Device. These cookies track the
											performance of the Website and how it is used by visitors,
											all with the aim of improving its functionality. The
											information obtained can be used to create a unique
											"fingerprint" of the visitor, which will identify you on
											other websites you may visit and can be used to create a
											profile of your online activities and interests.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b><i>Functionality Cookies (Preferences):</i></b> We use
											these to allow the Website to remember the choices made by
											visitors (such as the language or region in which the
											visitor is located and other elements of the Website that
											the visitor can influence), as well as any changes the
											visitor has made regarding this, all with the aim of
											providing an optimal user experience.
										</li>
										<li>
											<b
												><i
													>Targeting Cookies (Targeted Advertising -
													Marketing):</i
												></b
											>
											We use these to collect information from the Device for
											the purpose of displaying targeted advertising content to
											the visitor that may interest them or limiting the
											frequency of displaying certain advertising content, as
											well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising
											campaigns on the Website and other sites. They can
											remember that a visitor has visited a certain page of the
											Website and that this information is shared with third
											parties, including advertisers and agencies we collaborate
											with, and they may also be connected to the functionality
											of sites managed by third parties. In most cases, these
											cookies track visitors via the Device ID or IP address.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<br /><br />
									<h5>Non-Essential Cookies</h5>
									<br />

									<p>
										We use them for all business purposes that are not strictly
										necessary for the functioning of the Website:

									<li>Services We Use</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										Our Website uses various third-party services to provide you
										with an optimal user experience every time you visit our
										Website. Currently, we use services from the following
										providers: Google Analytics, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
									</p>
									<p>
										While we are fully aware of all the Technologies used by the
										mentioned service providers and have listed them in this
										Policy, we cannot guarantee that any of these Technologies
										will not be modified in any way. However, we guarantee that
										we will adequately represent any changes that occur after we
										become aware of them through amendments to this Policy.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Visitor Consent for Using Technologies</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										Storing all non-essential Technologies on the Device/browser
										of the Website visitor implies that the visitor is aware
										that the Website uses Technologies and has consented to this
										in accordance with this Policy and by selecting the
										appropriate option provided by Smart Benefit Technologies
										d.o.o. Belgrade during their visit to our Website.
									</p>

									<p>
										The visitor can freely and independently choose to prohibit
										the use of all Technologies except those necessary for the
										functioning of the Website, to allow the use of only those
										that are essential for the proper functioning of the
										Website, and not those that track their online behavior for
										marketing or other purposes, or to accept the use of all
										Technologies.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, visitors to our Website can change or revoke
										their consent at any time.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Modification/Revoke Consent</li>

										Visitors can influence the way Technologies are used at any
										time by adjusting the settings in the internet browser
										through which they access the Website. In this way, they
										also deny or revoke their consent for use.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Technologies we have mentioned may contain data about
										the identity of each visitor to the Website, for which the
										visitor has consented to be disclosed. Therefore, we would
										like to emphasize that if you do not give your consent to
										accept the mentioned Technologies or revoke it, access to
										the content of the Website, or the use of some of its
										features, may be limited to a lesser or greater extent.
