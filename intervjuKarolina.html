							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What do the benefits provided by the employer mean to you
									personally?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								From the employer's perspective, it is undeniable that
								<b>benefits are significant for <i>employer branding</i></b> and
								help the employer retain employees, as well as
								<b>attract new</b> talent.
							</p>
							<p>
								From the employees' perspective, I see benefits as something
								that has the potential to "make life easier" and
								<b
									>improve the quality of life and the daily lives of
									employees</b
								>. In some cases, benefits can facilitate individuals'
								decision-making, leaving them more time and money for things
								that matter to them. For example, if an employee has a paid gym
								membership or yoga classes, or meals at work, they don't have to
								think about it every day. It is known that
								<b
									>successful people try to reduce the number of decisions they
									make and speed up the decision-making process</b
								>. If someone has voluntary-private health insurance, the option
								to hire a therapist, financial or other advisor, or coach, then
								not only does it financially benefit the employee, but they also
								don't have to invest additional time to find the right service
								for themselves.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>In your opinion, to what extent can benefits affect employee
									satisfaction and engagement?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								This depends on several factors. For example, whether the
								benefits available to employees are truly the
								<b>benefits that they need</b>, which ease their lives and
								impact their quality of life. In this regard, it is important
								that there is communication between the employer and employees
								about their needs and periodic checks to see if those needs have
								changed.
							</p>
							<p>
								Providing benefits that suit everyone equally is challenging,
								which is why it is excellent
								<b
									>if employers have the opportunity to allow employees to
									choose benefits according to their preferences</b
								>. In this case, it is undeniable that benefits will positively
								impact employee satisfaction. Regarding employee engagement, I
								would refer back to my previous answer that if the benefits
								facilitate and enhance their lives, employees will be more
								relaxed, and their engagement will definitely be greater,
								leading to better performance.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, according to a survey by PwC, more than half of
								respondents said that financial or monetary issues/challenges
								cause them the most stress. Even 50% of employees who are
								stressed about their finances say it distracts them at work.
								Therefore, if the employer provides employees with financial
								education, support from financial advisors, and coaching to
								resolve financial uncertainties, it will positively affect
								employee engagement at work.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What benefits have you had the opportunity to use during your
									career that had the most positive impact on you personally?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The most significant benefit for me was the use of a company
								car.
							</p>
							<blockquote><i>Introduce your company</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								<a href="https://www.herbutkarolina.com/">Herbut Consulting</a>
								offers
								<b>financial education, consulting, and coaching</b> services,
								helping both individuals and legal entities, as well as their
								employees, to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>take control of their finances,</li>
								<li>create passive income and additional earnings,</li>
								<li>increase savings,</li>
								<li>achieve their personal and business goals.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Karolina Herbut, the founder of Herbut Consulting, launched the
								first online course on personal finance in our region, an e-book
								“Managing Personal Finances,” and a unique printed financial
								notebook that can be attended or purchased by anyone who wants
								to invest in their financial education and increase their
								financial literacy.

							/>

							<blockquote>
								<i
									>Introduce your services and benefits that your company
									provides</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Among the benefits we offer, I would highlight the
								<a
									href="https://www.herbutkarolina.com/online-kurs-o-finansijama/"
									>online course on personal finance</a
								>
								which is available independently (<b>STANDARD package</b>), as
								well as with
								<b>1-on-1 consultations with a financial advisor</b> (<b
									>INVEST package</b
								>). The course consists of seven modules: beliefs and attitudes
								towards money, goal setting, creating a simple financial plan,
								ideas for cost optimization, additional income and creating
								passive income, investing and saving, and finally, automating
								finances.
							</p>
							<p>
								Regarding
								<a
									href="https://www.herbutkarolina.com/licni-finansijski-savetnik-individualne-konsultacije/"
									>1-on-1 consultations</a
								>
								with a financial advisor, they cover the following topics: 1)
								what are the savings and investment options in Serbia, and 2)
								how to set up a system for tracking your finances and create a
								personal financial plan.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to the personal finance course packages and
								consultations, we also offer
								<a
									href="https://www.herbutkarolina.com/e-knjiga-upravljanje-licnim-finansijama/"
									>the e-book “Managing Personal Finances”</a
								>. The book consists of 7 sections, each accompanied by
								worksheets that anyone can fill out according to their own
								examples. All benefits provided by “Herbut Consulting”
								<b>are available online</b>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will continue to expand and adapt the list of benefits to
								meet the needs of employees and employers, so we will add
								consultations on housing loans, business coaching services, as
								well as other services from our expertise as needed, based on
								the interest expressed by employees and employers.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What is the greatest value of the benefits your company
									provides for employees?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								I would say that there are two greatest values:
								<b>financial freedom and financial control</b>. These are also
								the two most common motivations for which clients come to me.
								Many find it important to build financial freedom, to be able to
								be
								<b
									>masters of their time and money, to learn how to manage the
									money</b
								>
								they have, and at the same time, to find sources of additional
								income. On the other hand, some experience a feeling of not
								having control over their money, that no matter how much they
								earn, their finances slip away, and they want to change that.
								During the financial course and consultations, we specifically
								cover these topics and address the question
								<b>HOW to achieve one's financial goals</b>. When you know where
								your money goes, when you can spend money without guilt and set
								aside a part of it for saving or investing, you then have
								control over your finances and find yourself in a state of
								peace. Today, we need that state more than ever before, and the
								key values I would highlight are peace and freedom.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What are the biggest challenges companies face today when
									creating employee benefit programs?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								As the biggest challenge, I would highlight
								<b
									>the creation of a benefits program that can meet the needs
									and desires of employees, considering that these needs are
									constantly changing</b
								>. That’s why I believe that the platform
								<a href="https://benefiti.rs/">Benefiti.rs</a> is excellent, as
								it allows employers to offer their employees a variety of
								benefits in one place, whether it’s a finance course, yoga
								classes, coaching, or other options, which employees can choose
								according to their current needs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, I see another
								<b
									>great advantage of personalized benefits – the responsibility
									for choosing the benefits lies with the employees
									themselves</b
								>.
							</p>

							/>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>Has the new situation with the pandemic influenced you to
									change your approach to providing your service?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								I launched the online finance course back in early 2019 because
								I believed that online programs offer new opportunities:
								flexibility, time savings, and the ability to attend from
								different places and countries. The pandemic influenced our
								services so that we also transitioned other programs (workshops)
								and services (consultations, coaching) online.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i>Who is the team behind all of this?</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The owner of <b>Herbut Consulting</b> is
								<a href="https://www.herbutkarolina.com/about/"
									>Karolina Herbut</a
								>, a financial advisor, educator, and coach. Karolina is also
								the president of the
								<b>Center for Financial Education and Empowerment</b> (CEFIN).
								She advocates for increasing
								<b
									>financial literacy, gender equality, and the economic
									empowerment of citizens</b
								>. The development and functioning of these programs are
								supported by a group of collaborators consisting of experts from
								the financial sector, marketing specialists, and invaluable
								support from a programmer and designer.

Well, there&#x27;s still some hope; once I&#x27;ve got the money together to pay off my parents&#x27; debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ll do.</p>

It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o&#x27;clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?</p>
