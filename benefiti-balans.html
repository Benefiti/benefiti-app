							<p>
								The partners whose services we offer through the Benefiti.app
								platform are extremely important to us. Without them, we as a
								platform would not function, and we believe we share the same
								values. Therefore, we love to hear their opinions on benefits in
								general. As part of our blog section, we decided to ask our
								partners what benefits mean to them and what specific benefits
								they can offer to companies and their employees.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe that there are benefits that are particularly
								important to employees. Education, psychological support, and
								support for parents are some of the values we consider crucial
								for employee satisfaction.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Balance Consulting</b> and <b>Kompas Vaspitanje</b> offer all
								these services on the Benefiti platform, making them ideal
								partners for our platform.
							</p>
							<p>
								Below, read the interview with Jelena Marušić from Balance
								Consulting, a graduate psychologist, trainer of developmental
								skills, parenting advisor, and founder of Kompas Vaspitanje.

							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What do the benefits provided by employers to employees
									personally mean to you?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								When there is an understanding from the employer regarding
								personal situations, such as when our child is sick or we are
								not feeling well, this can be a strong benefit for employees
								because they feel that the employer listens to problems that are
								not work-related but can affect work. Employees are often
								willing to engage in additional training, and the environment
								they work in can be important to them, including whether they
								have refreshments during breaks. Some people enjoy traveling and
								activities that motivate them to take action, which can be
								facilitated through team-building events. Additionally, support
								for personal development, flexibility, freedom of expression,
								nurturing proactivity and idea implementation, a sense of
								"ownership" over projects, and the possibility of interest-free
								loans are benefits that give employees the feeling that the
								employer cares about them.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>In your opinion, to what extent can benefits influence
									employee satisfaction and engagement?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Benefits can contribute to satisfaction and engagement because
								they send a message about how much the employer listens to
								employees, recognizes their needs, and thereby provides
								employees with a sense of security.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What benefits have you had the opportunity to use during your
									career that had the most positive impact on you personally?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Personally, the most positive impact has been the understanding
								from the employer and the time spent with the team outside of
								work (of course, everything mentioned in the first question as
								well).
							</p>
							<blockquote><i>Introduce your company</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								Balance Consulting provides support to organizations in the area
								of their most important resource - <i>people</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Balance team believes in potential and aims to support
								individuals in their process of progress and development. Our
								team consists of psychotherapists, certified coaches, and
								parenting advisors. We strive to support our clients in an
								empathetic, creative, and practical way. In 2018, we celebrated
								a decade of nurturing creativity, courage, flexibility, and
								development, which are actually our core values.
							</p>
							<p>
								Balance Consulting is located in Kragujevac, and their services
								are also available online.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i>Present the services/benefits that the company provides</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								Balance Consulting offers services for the individual
								development of employees' personal potential, such as
								<b><i>coaching</i></b
								>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Coaching</i> is an interactive process that supports
								individuals in developing their potential and motivates them to
								achieve better results. Coaching is a true benefit for those who
								are ready to take responsibility and demonstrate commitment.
								Coaching is realized through clients choosing the challenges
								they want to work on, and together with the coach, they find all
								the necessary resources to achieve their goals.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to coaching, the services of
								<b><i>psychotherapeutic support</i></b> became particularly
								prominent during 2020. Psychotherapy is a process aimed at
								improving mental health as well as providing support in
								overcoming mental and emotional issues through conversation.
								During psychotherapy, clients learn and gain numerous insights
								about their states and moods, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.
								By using the knowledge gained during psychotherapy, individuals
								adopt healthy coping skills for managing problems and stress.
							</p>
							<p>
								Balance Consulting, through its project Kompas vaspitanje
								(vaspitanje.com), offers a service of
								<b><i>support for employee parents</i></b
								>. Establishing a balance between work and family is not at all
								easy and is very important. Most parents find it challenging to
								set boundaries while showing love to their children
								simultaneously. It often happens that in the struggle with their
								own stress, they are either rigid and the constant answer is no,
								or they overly indulge their children to please them. During
								individual or group work, parents receive full support,
								necessary knowledge, techniques, guidelines, as well as
								assistance without bias or judgment. This way, parents become
								encouraged and better prepared to care for their children.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What is the greatest value of the benefits your company
									provides to employees?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The greatest benefit they receive is the care for employees and
								the feeling that the company takes care of them in a holistic
								way, regarding them as people, not just as employees.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through working with parents, they receive concrete guidelines
								and tools on how to establish a good relationship with their
								children. During psychotherapy, they receive specific tools they
								can use in the field of their mental health.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>What are the biggest challenges companies face today when
									creating benefit programs for employees?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								There is a wide selection of benefits. The biggest challenge is
								assessing what constitutes a benefit from the employees'
								perspective.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i
									>Has the new situation with the pandemic influenced you to
									change your approach to providing your service?</i
								>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The new situation with the pandemic has made certain services,
								such as employee mental health and care for parents, a priority
								for organizations at this moment. Something that was discussed
								earlier has now come to the forefront.
							</p>
							<blockquote><i>Who is the team behind all this?</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								<b>Marija Švigir</b> is the founder of Balance Consulting.
								Marija believes in balance, inspiration, and change. She thinks
								that one of the most beautiful things we can afford is to live
								and work in accordance with our personal values. On her path of
								personal development, what matters more to her is what she is
								now than what she has been.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Jelena Marušić</b> loves her job, and her motivation is the
								trust of clients who guide her on the path of change, which she
								earns through her dedication and responsibility. The business
								environment, expectations, and challenges of parenthood place
								great responsibility on employee parents, which is why Jelena
								founded Kompas vaspitanje—a support program for parents.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Dubravka Đorđević</b> - loves challenges and working with
								people. She believes that individuals possess unlimited
								capabilities when they are inspired and focused on what truly
								matters to them. Besides coaching, which she uses for individual
								development, she enjoys the exchange of energy that comes from
								conducting group training sessions. She strives to improve the
								workday in Serbia.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Uroš Mitić</b> - Uroš focuses on the development of
								individuals, teams, and organizations. The tools and concepts he
								applies in his work come from the integration of psychology and
								transactional analysis. His areas of interest include coaching,
								soft skills training, and human resource management in areas
								such as establishing procedures, recruitment, and selection,
								etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Ksenija Stanković</b> is an advocate of the idea that without
								will and liberated consciousness, we cannot create authentic
								change that brings positive results. Her spheres of interest
								include personality assessment, training, and pedagogical
								psychology, which she applies through the implementation of the
								Kompas vaspitanje program.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Sara Dulčić</b> - since her student days, she has been
								involved in organizing numerous projects, humanitarian actions,
								and conferences, during which she had the opportunity to work on
								interpersonal relationships. In addition to accounting and
								finance, which she focused on during her studies, she has
								developed various soft skills and sparked an interest in
								marketing and HR.

            <p>And it&#x27;s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there&#x27;s still some hope; once I&#x27;ve got the money together to pay off my parents&#x27; debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ll do.</p>
            <p>That&#x27;s when I&#x27;ll make the big change.

It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o&#x27;clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?</p>
            <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &quot;What&#x27;s happened to me? &quot; he thought. It wasn&#x27;t a dream.</p>
