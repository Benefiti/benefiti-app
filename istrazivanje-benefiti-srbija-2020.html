							<p>
								In an effort to learn firsthand what the biggest challenges are
								in providing benefits to employees in companies in Serbia, we
								conducted a study titled “<b
									>The State of Employee Benefits in Companies in Serbia</b
								>” in September 2020, the key results of which we share with you
								in this text.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we surveyed
								<b>109 representatives of companies operating in Serbia</b> on
								one side and <b>204 employees</b> on the other, which helped us
								view the key challenges from both perspectives. In the
								companies, we mostly spoke with HR and Comp&Ben managers who are
								directly involved in the process of creating and implementing
								employee benefit programs.
							</p>
							<p>
								We made an effort to ensure that the
								<b>sample is representative</b> in terms of
								<b>industries and company sizes</b>, so we included 21 companies
								from the segment of small and micro companies (up to 50
								employees), 44 companies from the medium segment (51 to 250
								employees), and we also spoke with 21 representatives from
								companies with 250 to 1,000 employees, as well as with 23
								representatives from companies employing more than 1,000
								employees.
							</p>
							<p>
								Among the industries, the most represented is IT (36 companies),
								followed by: manufacturing (11 companies), retail/FMCG (10),
								finance and banking (10), telecommunications (9),
								pharmaceuticals and healthcare (9), consulting and professional
								services (8), etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								Regarding the sample of employees, we also paid attention to
								representativeness based on criteria such as salary levels,
								seniority, and the age of the respondents.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is important to note that the research was conducted in
								September 2020, so it took into account the changes in the area
								of providing benefits to employees caused by the COVID-19
								pandemic.

							<blockquote><i>Key Insights</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								Although companies invest significant resources in employee
								benefits (<b>7.69% of gross salary</b>),
								<b
									>the benefits are not tailored to the individual needs of
									employees -</b
								>
								<b>75.1%</b> of employees said they
								<b>do not participate in the selection of benefits</b>, and
								<b>30.5%</b> reported that they
								<b
									>do not have a clear picture of what benefits are actually
									offered</b
								>
								by the company they work for. The underutilization of benefits
								represents an additional cost for the company -
								<b
									>only 41.8% of employees say they fully utilize the available
									benefits</b
								>
								(in other words, nearly 60% of employees fail to fully take
								advantage of them). Moreover, <b>81.1%</b> of surveyed HR
								representatives say they
								<b
									>do not have a systematic approach to measuring the effects of
									benefits</b
								>, or their actual impact on employee engagement, satisfaction,
								motivation, and retention.
							</p>
							<p>
								We already intuitively knew and expected this information, but
								the great value of the research lies in the fact that everything
								has been validated and quantified through a methodological
								study.
							</p>
							<br />
							<img src="./images/tajana1.png" alt="image1" />
							<blockquote><i>The Importance of Benefits</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								It is clear that benefits are not the most important factor when
								we talk about employee motivation and retention. According to
								the annual global survey by Manpower Group, depending on age
								category, specialization, seniority, and industry, benefits rank
								between 4th and 6th place on the priority list of factors
								influencing employee motivation and retention.
							</p>
							<p>
								According to our research,
								<b>41.18% of employees and 40% of HR and Comp&Ben</b> managers
								believe that benefits are a very important, often crucial factor
								for candidates when choosing a new employer, while 57.75% of
								employees and 60% of HR managers consider them important, but
								not a decisive factor.
							</p>
							<br />
							<img src="./images/tajana2.png" alt="image2" />
							<blockquote>
								<i>Adaptability of Benefits to Employee Needs</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The key challenge with benefits at this time is the ability of
								companies to tailor them to each individual employee.
							</p>
							<p>
								First of all, it is important to highlight that <b>30.48%</b> of
								employees say they
								<b>do not fully understand what benefits their company offers</b
								>, which suggests that there is insufficient internal
								communication within organizations regarding benefits.
								Additionally, <b>75.09%</b> of employees say they do not have
								the opportunity to participate in the selection of benefits that
								their company offers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, when we talk about how
								<b
									>tailored the benefits offered by the company are to their
									needs</b
								>, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents "one size fits
								all," meaning completely non-personalized benefits,
								<b>28.8%</b> of employees gave the lowest rating to their
								employer in this segment, which is also agreed upon by
								<b>17%</b> of HR managers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Generally speaking, the average rating for the level of
								customization of benefits given by employees is <b>2.56</b>,
								while HR managers rated it slightly higher (<b>2.77</b> on a
								scale from 1 to 5).
							</p>
							<br />
							<img src="./images/tajana3.png" alt="image3" />
							<blockquote><i>Utilization of Benefits</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								One of the results of the research is that
								<b>"only" 41.76%</b> of employees fully manage to utilize the
								benefits provided by the company they work for. In other words,
								nearly 60% of employees do not fully take advantage of what
								their company has provided and often paid for. <b>31.32%</b> of
								them say they do not use all the available benefits because they
								are not tailored to their needs, and <b>25.52%</b> say that the
								nature of their work does not allow them to fully utilize the
								available benefits. <b>4.4%</b> say they do not use any benefits
								at all.
							</p>
							<br />

							<img src="./images/tajana4.png" alt="slika4" />

							<blockquote>
								<i>Systematic Approach to Measuring the Effects of Benefits</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								A modest <b>18.87%</b> of HR and Comp&Ben managers say that
								there is a systematic approach in their companies to measuring
								the impact of benefits on employee satisfaction, and to a large
								extent, this is part of the annual Employee Satisfaction Survey,
								in which questions about benefits are only a minor area being
								assessed.
							</p>
							<blockquote><i>Remote Benefits</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								<b>"Remote benefits"</b> are all those benefits for which the
								user (employee) can be located anywhere. Some examples include:
								online coaching, online education (trainings, workshops),
								assessments, online psychologists and psychotherapists,
								telemedicine (consultations with doctors), online fitness
								(working with a trainer, Pilates, yoga...), streaming services,
								online learning platforms, mindfulness applications, online
								education for employees' children, virtual assistants, financial
								counseling, food delivery, and other necessities, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>51%</b> of companies stated that during the early waves of
								the pandemic (spring and summer), they included this type of
								benefit in their offerings.
							</p>
							<blockquote><i>Share of Benefits in Earnings</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								On average, companies allocate a significant <b>7.69%</b> of
								their salary budget for benefits.
							</p>
							<p>
								The majority of companies allocate between 5% and 10%—39% of
								them; less than 5% is allocated by 38% of companies, while
								14.63% of companies invest between 10% and 15% in employee
								benefits. Between 15% and 20%, <b>7.32%</b> of companies invest
								in employee benefits.
							</p>
							<p>
								For comparison, in the USA, companies allocate about 32% of the
								gross earnings of their employees for the same purpose (2018
								EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, The Evolution of Benefits).
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								<i>Budget Projection for Benefits for 2021</i>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								The perspective of HR and Comp&Ben managers regarding the budget
								for benefits launched for 2021 was interesting.
							</p>
							<p>
								To a large extent (<b>60%</b>), company representatives believed
								that the
								<b
									>benefit budget for 2021 would be similar to that of the
									previous year.</b
								>
							</p>
							<p>
								As many as <b>17%</b> predicted <b>17%</b> of this budget, while
								<b>5%</b> expected a
								<b>significant increase in the budget</b> (over 10%).
							</p>
							<p>
								Among the more pessimistic group, which predicted a decrease in
								the budget for benefits, <b>12%</b> of companies expected
								<b>moderate reductions (up to 10%)</b>, while <b>6%</b> of
								companies expected
								<b>significant reductions (more than 10%)</b>.
							</p>
							<br />
							<img src="./images/tajana5.png" alt="image5" />
							<blockquote><i>In Conclusion</i></blockquote>
							<p>
								The results of the 2020 research confirmed the assumptions on
								which the <b>Benefiti.app platform</b> was created, as well as
								the results of our preliminary research from May and June 2019.
							</p>
							<p>
								With this 2020 research, we aimed to
								<b>methodologically validate the previous knowledge</b> we
								gained during the development process of our platform. It has
								been shown once again that employee benefits in Serbia are
								indeed important to both employees and companies (<b
									>57.75% of employees and 60% of HR managers</b
								>
								see them as an important factor in choosing an employer), as
								well as that a significant portion of company funds is spent on
								them (<b>7.69% of gross earnings</b>).
							</p>
							<p>
								However, the main challenge arises from the conclusion that
								employees are not consulted about what benefits they want to use
								(<b>75.1%</b>), and in <b>30.5%</b> of cases, they do not even
								know what benefits their company offers. The situation is
								further complicated by the fact that although companies spend
								significant funds on benefits, <b>60%</b> of employees
								<b>fail to fully utilize available benefits</b>. This lack of
								personalization and the "one-size-fits-all" approach motivated
								us to launch the Benefiti.app platform, which allows each
								employee to choose benefits according to their needs while still
								being within the budget defined by the employer.
							</p>
							<p>
								By providing benefits, companies aim to show additional care for
								their employees and a desire to further motivate them, thus
								reducing employee turnover. In practice, it has been shown that
								benefits can influence <b>employee motivation and loyalty</b> to
								the company. However, the fact is that most companies
								<b
									>do not have a systematic approach to measuring the impact of
									benefits</b
								>
								(<b>81.1%</b> of surveyed HR professionals confirm this),
								meaning they do not know to what extent and which specific
								benefits affect motivation, so the company does not have a true
								insight into the importance of benefits for their employees.
							</p>
							<p>
								The <b>Benefiti.app platform</b> tackles all these challenges,
								aiming to enable companies to systematically measure the impact
								of benefits on employee satisfaction and motivation, while
								allowing employees to truly receive what they want: benefits
								they choose and can change on a monthly basis.

            <p>And it&#x27;s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there&#x27;s still some hope; once I&#x27;ve got the money together to pay off my parents&#x27; debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that&#x27;s definitely what I&#x27;ll do.</p>

It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o&#x27;clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?</p>
