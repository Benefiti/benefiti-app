									<li>Date of Issuance of the Privacy Notice</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										This Privacy Notice (<b>Notice</b>) was issued on February
										25, 2021.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Purpose of Notification</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										With this Notice, we aim to provide you with information in
										an easily understandable and transparent manner regarding
										how SBT processes personal data of individuals to whom the
										data relates, which categories of personal data SBT
										processes, and what rights individuals to whom the data
										relates have. We process your personal data on behalf of the
										companies we collaborate with (Clients) to:
									</p>
									<ol type="(i)">
										<li>
											enable our Clients to enjoy all the benefits of using our
											software platform Benefiti.rs (Platform), through which
											they, in their capacity as employers and data controllers,
											provide their employees (End Users) with personalized,
											flexible, and measurable benefits and incentives within
											their predefined budget (Benefits);
										</li>
										<li>
											allow Clients to deliver selected Benefits to End Users.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>
										All personal data mentioned in this Notice is processed and
										protected in full compliance with the Serbian Law on
										Personal Data Protection (ZZPL) and the General Data
										Protection Regulation (GDPR), and solely based on the
										written instructions of the Client as the data controller.
									</p>

									<ol type="A">
										<li>
											Personal data refers to any data relating to an identified
											or identifiable natural person, such as personal name,
											year of birth, photograph, or location. Data that is
											anonymized is not considered personal data.
										</li>
										<li>
											Processing refers to any action or set of actions
											performed on personal data or sets of personal data (e.g.,
											collection, storage, use, reproduction, disclosure,
											deletion, or destruction).
										</li>
									</ol>

									<br />
									<li>Amendments and Supplements</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										This is the latest version of the Notice (February 25,
										2021).
									</p>
									<p>
										SBT reserves the right to amend this Notice at any time. In
										the event that the Notice is amended or supplemented, we
										will enter the date of the latest version of the document.
										We will inform you promptly of any changes to the Notice.
										Please keep in mind that amendments and supplements to this
										Notice do not in any way affect the Privacy Notice prepared
										by the Client or any third party regarding the Platform or
										Benefits.
									</p>
									<br />

									<li>About Us</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										In this Notice, "SBT," "we," and "our" refer to Smart
										Benefit Technologies d.o.o. Belgrade, with its registered
										office at Takovska Street No. 12, Belgrade-Palilula,
										Republic of Serbia.
									</p>
									<p>
										SBT acts solely as a processor in the processing of your
										personal data:
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											When we process data of End Users on behalf of Clients as
											controllers, which Clients and End Users leave on the
											Platform;
										</li>
										<li>
											When we process personal data of End Users provided to us
											by Clients on behalf of Clients to enable the delivery of
											selected Benefits to End Users. We do this on behalf of
											Clients who have engaged us for this purpose in the form
											of purchasing Benefits from their business partners
											(Partners) and transferring rights to them to Clients, as
											Clients are unable to independently deliver selected
											Benefits to End Users. In this way, SBT enables its
											Clients to achieve the delivery of selected Benefits to
											End Users in the fastest and most efficient manner based
											on a concluded business cooperation agreement for the
											provision of selected Benefits.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Clients are controllers in the processing of your personal
										data since they determine the purpose and means by which
										your personal data is collected, used, and otherwise
										processed, while we provide services for using the Platform
										on their behalf, namely services enabling the delivery of
										selected Benefits to End Users.
									</p>
									<p><i>Other Privacy Notices on the Platform</i></p>
									<p>
										The Client, as the controller in the processing of your
										personal data, has created a separate privacy notice in
										accordance with its legal obligation under the ZZPL, which
										is available to you when logging into our Platform. SBT
										cannot be held liable to the data subjects in any way if the
										controller fails to inform the data subjects of any
										circumstances it was required to transparently present in
										its privacy notice.
									</p>

									<p>
										Questions, complaints, requests to exercise your rights, and
										additional information regarding this Notice and the
										protection of personal data at SBT can be obtained via the
										following email address:
										<a href="mailto: gdpr@benefiti.rs">gdpr@benefiti.rs</a>.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Personal Data We Collect</li>

									<br />
									<p>
										<i
											>Based on the cooperation agreement with Clients regarding
											the use of the Platform</i
										>
									</p>

									<ol type="A">
										<li>
											Enabling the use of the Platform and training for using
											the Platform
										</li>
										<br />
										<p>
											When Clients use our Platform to enable their employees,
											as End Users, to select Benefits, view the status of
											selected Benefits, and manage them, while providing them
											with different rights on the Platform depending on their
											role within the Client's company (admin, HR, employee), we
											process personal data of the End Users on behalf of the
											Clients.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition, SBT processes personal data of the End Users
											on behalf of the Clients for the purpose of training the
											End Users who will use the Platform, depending on the
											extent of the rights assigned to them by the Clients.
										</p>
										<p>
											The personal data we collect at that time includes, but is
											not limited to, the following categories of personal data:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Identification data, such as: first and last name, date
												of birth, gender;
											</li>
											<li>
												Contact details, such as: business email address,
												personal email address, business and personal landline
												or mobile phone numbers;
											</li>
											<li>
												Employment data: exact title and position of the End
												User in the Client's company, date of employment with
												the Client, hierarchical level within the Client (e.g.,
												Junior, Medior, Senior, etc.), scope of rights the End
												User has on the Platform relative to their position in
												the Client's company (e.g., Admin, HR, employee), name
												of the team the End User belongs to;
											</li>
											<li>Personal status data, such as marital status;</li>
											<li>
												Data about the active account of the End User on various
												electronic digital services, for example, when the End
												User selects Benefits provided by digital service
												providers;
											</li>
											<li>
												Data about the unique user code, which SBT generates for
												the End User in the event that the selected Benefit
												represents a voucher/coupon/code;
											</li>
											<li>
												Data about the consumption habits and interests of End
												Users, such as the selection of specific Benefits when
												using the Platform;
											</li>
											<li>Data about the cultural identity of End Users;</li>
											<li>Data about the social identity of End Users;</li>
											<li>
												Data about the physiological identity of End Users;
											</li>
											<li>Data about the mental identity of End Users;</li>
											<li>
												Other data about the use of the Platform, such as data
												obtained from insights into the activities on the End
												User's account (the number of tokens available to the
												End User, the current status of the available number of
												tokens, and changes in the number of tokens in relation
												to availability), as well as data about realized
												Benefits.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											SBT, in this case, processes the specified personal data
											as a data processor to enable Clients to use the Platform
											to its full extent, based on the concluded contract with
											the Clients regarding business cooperation in the use of
											the Platform.
										</p>
										<li>Technical Support</li>
										<br />
										<p>
											SBT, as a processor on behalf of the Client, also
											processes information about user sessions (such as loading
											errors and response times), as well as data related to
											communication with customer support via phone, email, and
											written correspondence regarding inquiries submitted by
											End Users (communication channel, type of inquiry, date,
											time, content). We process the mentioned data to provide
											Clients with customer support aimed at ensuring
											uninterrupted use of the Platform, based on the business
											cooperation agreement regarding the use of the Platform,
											which also includes providing technical support by SBT.
										</p>
										<p>
											Based on the business cooperation agreement with Clients
											regarding the provision of selected Benefits to End Users.
										</p>

										<li>
											Enabling the delivery of selected Benefits to End Users
										</li>
										<br />

										<p>
											In order to enable Clients to deliver selected Benefits to
											End Users on behalf of the Clients, we process the
											personal data of End Users provided to us by the Clients,
											which relates to, but is not limited to, the following
											categories of personal data:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												<i>Personal identification data</i>, such as: first name
												and last name, date of birth, gender;
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Contact details</i>, such as: business email address,
												personal email address, business and personal landline
												or mobile phone numbers;
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Job-related data:</i> exact title and position that
												the End User holds in the Client's company, start date
												of employment with the Client, hierarchical level within
												the Client (e.g., Junior, Medior, Senior, etc.), scope
												of rights that the End User has on the Platform in
												relation to their position in the Client's company
												(e.g., Admin, HR, employee), name of the team to which
												the End User belongs;
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Data about the active End User account</i> on various
												electronic digital services, for example, when the End
												User selects Benefits provided by digital service
												providers;
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Data about a unique user code,</i> which SBT
												generates for the End User in the event that the
												selected Benefit represents a voucher/coupon/code.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											SBT, as the processor of personal data of End Users,
											particularly notes and emphasizes that it acts as a
											processor of personal data of End Users concerning their
											active user account on various electronic digital services
											only and exclusively when processing this data based on
											written instructions from the controller at the moment
											when the End User is an employee of the controller. SBT
											bears no responsibility for the processing of such data if
											the processing occurs based on instructions from the
											controller after the individual to whom the data relates
											has ceased to be employed by the Client company, since SBT
											cannot and is not obliged to independently verify the
											status of the individual to whom the data relates within
											the Client company.
										</p>
									</ol>
									<br />
									<li>Purpose of Processing and Legal Basis for Processing</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										The Client, as the controller in the processing of your
										personal data, determines the purpose and legal basis on
										which your personal data is processed. Data processing is
										most often carried out based on a signed employment
										contract, based on the legitimate interest of the
										controller, or when processing is necessary to protect the
										vital interests of the individual to whom the data relates
										or another individual.
									</p>
									<p>
										If you have questions regarding the purpose or legal basis
										on which the Client, as the controller in processing your
										data, processes your personal data, or if you need
										additional information regarding this, please contact the
										Client, i.e., your employer as the controller in the
										processing of your personal data.
									</p>

									<li>Platform</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										Our Platform collects certain personal data from all
										Platform users with your consent using technologies that the
										Platform employs (cookies/trackers) and stores them in
										files. If you would like to learn more about this, including
										exactly what personal data we collect at that time, please
										read our Platform Policy.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Recipients of Personal Data</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										On the one hand, when we enable Clients to use our Platform
										and related activities, SBT retains your personal data
										during the period of use of the Platform by the Clients and
										thereafter for a certain period to allow Clients, in their
										capacity as controllers, to recover the user accounts of End
										Users. Once an End User’s profile is deactivated, regardless
										of the reason for deactivation by the End User, the Client
										will decide whether to delete or anonymize such personal
										data, unless there is a legal obligation to retain the data,
										and SBT will act in accordance with the received
										instruction.
									</p>
									<p>
										On the other hand, when we process your personal data to
										enable Clients to deliver selected Benefits to End Users,
										SBT retains your personal data for a strictly limited time
										frame, which includes the period from the moment of
										purchasing Benefits from Partners to the moment of
										transferring rights to the Benefits to the Clients. After
										that, the Client will decide whether to delete or anonymize
										such personal data, unless there is a legal obligation to
										retain the data, and SBT will act in accordance with the
										received instruction.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Client, as the controller in the processing of your
										personal data, and we also retain your personal data if
										their processing is necessary for the submission,
										realization, or defense of a legal claim. To the extent
										possible, your controller will limit the processing of data
										for such purposes after the contractual relationship with
										our company has ended.
									</p>
									<p>
										For more information regarding how and for how long your
										personal data is retained, as well as for more information
										about your right to erasure and data portability, please
										contact the Client as your controller.
									</p>

									<br />
									<li>Integrity of Personal Data</li>
									<br />

									<p>
										We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
										data we process is reliable for its intended use, accurate,
										complete, and up-to-date. You are responsible for the
										accuracy of all personal data you provide to us. We will
										make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and
										integrity of the personal data obtained and to update it as
										necessary.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Security of Personal Data</li>
									<br />

									<p>
										Our company takes appropriate security measures to protect
										your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure
										in accordance with this Notice, as well as in compliance
										with the Law on Personal Data Protection (ZZPL) and the
										General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
									</p>
									<p>
										We implement appropriate physical, procedural, technical,
										organizational, and personnel measures to achieve an
										adequate level of protection for your personal data that we
										process. We apply the best industry standards in data
										protection. Protection covers loss, purpose misuse,
										unauthorized access and disclosure, alteration, and
										destruction of personal data. However, no security measure
										can guarantee that personal data will be 100% protected.
										Still, Benefits continuously improve all security measures
										at all times to protect your personal data with their
										controlled processes and high responsibility.
									</p>
									<br />
									<li>Your Rights</li>
									<br />
									<p>
										As a data subject, you can exercise certain rights with
										respect to the personal data processed about you by the
										Client as the controller. However, we specifically emphasize
										that it is important to understand and be clearly informed
										that SBT is merely a processor concerning the processing of
										your personal data and, as such, cannot respond to or
										fulfill any request for the exercise of your rights as a
										data subject, unless we have received such written
										instruction. Therefore, in the event that any such request
										for the exercise of your rights is directed to our address,
										we will forward it to the Client as the controller as soon
										as possible.
									</p>
									<p>You have the following rights:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											Information: the right to be informed about how we process
											your personal data;
										</li>
										<li>
											Access: the right to request access to all your personal
											data that we process;
										</li>
										<li>
											Correction/Completion: the right to request the immediate
											correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data about
											you;
										</li>
										<li>
											Deletion: the right to request the immediate deletion of
											your personal data;
										</li>
										<li>
											Restriction: the right to request a restriction on the
											processing of your personal data in certain situations;
										</li>
										<li>
											Objection: the right to object to specific processing of
											personal data;
										</li>
										<li>
											Portability: the right to request that we transfer this
											data to another company if the processing is based on
											consent or a contract and is carried out by automated
											means.
										</li>
									</ul>

									<p>
										Please send all requests to exercise your rights to the
										appropriate address of the Client. Only if they deem it
										appropriate will the Clients, as the data controllers,
										provide us with written instructions on how to handle your
										request.
									</p>
									<p>
										At any time, if you believe that your rights as the data
										subject are restricted or violated in any way, you can file
										a complaint with the Commissioner for Information of Public
										Importance and Personal Data Protection.
